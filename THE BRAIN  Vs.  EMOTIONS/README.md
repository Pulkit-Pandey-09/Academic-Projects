THE BRAIN Vs. THE EMOTIONS
The essence of Emotions always revolves around living beings, and majorly Humans.
We live in a world, where we are surrounded by people at every significant stage of life
playing different roles. This was prime inspiration, therefore, the project focuses to analyze the variations in the emotions of a human being throughout the life-cycle, through all its stages due to
variation in experience and physical changes of the brain due to aging. We can classify Stages of Human Life as mentioned above, where Infancy can further be classified as Intra-Uterine period and Post-Natal Development period. Similarly,
Childhood may be classified as Early and Later Childhood, Adolescence may be - Early Teenage and Later Teenage and finally Old Age may be categorized as Later Adulthood
and Death.This is the complete Human Life Cycle which involves innumerous variations in Emotions as well as the physical structure of the Brain ( Experience & Aging).
In this project, we will be technically delving into the very first stage of Human Life, that is Infancy. Furthermore, this creates an overwhelming Future Scope of the Project
and may be pursued further for the later Four Stages in great detail.
After all, the world's a stage and we are all actors!
