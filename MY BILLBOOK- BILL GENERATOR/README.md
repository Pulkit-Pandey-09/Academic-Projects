<h3> MY BILLBOOK - BILL GENERATOR</h3>
</br>
</br>

In this era of advancement, we very acknowledge the importance of integration of
hardware and programming. Today, more and more embedded hardware devices are reaching the
market and consumers with a demand for smaller and better devices than yesterday. Increasing the
performance of a device decreases the operating time since more power is consumed, still, decreasing
the size of the device also decreases operating time as the battery size decreases. This report presents
the implementation of assembly language to build a proposed hardware that generates the
report(example â€“ bill generator) automatically based on the user demand. 
</br>
The old manual system of data generator (bill generator) was suffering from a series of drawbacks.
Since whole of the system was to be maintained with hands the process of keeping, maintaining and
retrieving the information was very tedious and lengthy. The records were never used to be in a
systematic order. there used to be lots of difficulties in associating any particular transaction with a
particular context. If any information was to be found it was required to go through the different
registers, documents there would never exist anything like report generation. There would always be
unnecessary consumption of time while entering records and retrieving records. One more problem
was that it was very difficult to find errors while entering the records. Once the records were entered
it was very difficult to update these records.
It was not more user(consumer) friendly. It required huge amount of human labour in selection of
things which add up to inefficient working of old manual system.
This project work analyses the problem which is preferentially manually performed tasks which is a
great headache for the department. The reason behind it is that there is lot of information to be
maintained and have to be kept in mind while running the business .For this reason we have provided
features in present model we proposed in under this project which is fully automated
(computerized).
