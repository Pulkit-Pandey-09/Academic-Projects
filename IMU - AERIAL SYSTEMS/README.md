<h3> INERTIAL MEASUREMENT UNIT </h3>

An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, is an aerial system without
a human pilot on board. Its flight is either controlled autonomously by computers in the
vehicle. A common drone consist of four motors, control circuitry in middle and propellers
mounted on its rotors. Two rotors rotate in clockwise direction while other two in counter
clockwise directions to provide appropriate thrusts.
A quadcopter is an aircraft lifted and propelled by four horizontal rotors; each rotor consists
of two or three rotor blades. A four-propeller multi-copter is called a quad-copter, a six
propeller multi-copter is called a hexa-copter.
Each rotor produces both lift and torque about its centre of rotation, as well as drag opposite
to the vehicle's direction of flight. Quadcopters generally have two rotors spinning clockwise
(CW) and two counter-clockwise (CCW). Flight control is provided by independent variation
of the speed and hence lift and torque of each rotor. Pitch and roll are controlled by varying
the net centre of thrust, with yaw controlled by varying the net torque.

The GY-521 module is a breakout board for MPU-6050 MEMS (Microelectrochemical systems)
that features a 3-axis gyroscope, a 3-axis accelerometer, a digital motion processor (DMP),
and a temperature sensor. The digital motion processor can be used to process a complex
algorithms directly on the board. Inertial sensors are for aerial dynamics typically comes in
the form of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).
