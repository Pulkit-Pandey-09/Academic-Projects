<h3> ACTION POTENTIAL </h3>
This Document presents an overview of Mathematical Models described for the Stimuli and
Propagation of Action Potential in Cortical Nervous Tissues using Fundamental Laws of Physics. The agenda of
fabricating this project is to illuminate a concept that inculcates the complete Sciences i.e.- Physics, Mathematics,
Chemistry and Biology while majorly highlighting the Operations of Mathematical Modeling i.e. the Art of translating
problems from an Application area into tractable Mathematical Formulations whose Theoretical and Numerical
Analysis provides an insight, answers and guidance useful for the originating Application. Since, we present
Mathematical Modeling , the topics that incurred in our Application were Partial Differential Equations, Numerical
Analysis, Vector Calculus and Bifurcation Theory of Non-Dynamical Systems. Therefore a brief overview of all the
mentioned topics can be found in the document.
