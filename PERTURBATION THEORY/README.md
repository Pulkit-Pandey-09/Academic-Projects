<h1>PERTURBATION THEORY</h1>
</br>
In this era of advancement ,we very well acknowledge the use of Quantum Mechanics in
varied Technological Fronts like Atomic clocks, GPS Navigation, Telecommunication,
Cryptography and Super Powerful Computers. This Document presents an overview of the
Simulation proposed ,that is, Applications of Perturbation Theory and approximating the
error between the Theoretical and Experimental Values (as referenced). As we are already
aware that perturbation theory is a set of approximation methods directly related to
mathematical perturbation for describing a complicated Quantum System such as
Harmonic Oscillator , Stark Effect , Infinite Potential Well, Electron-Photon
Interaction.Therefore, Perturbation Equations can be very well Computed and Visually
represented in the form of Contour graphs through Matlab and can further be compiled
using Python or Javascript in order to fabricate an Interactive Simulation as a Final Result.
