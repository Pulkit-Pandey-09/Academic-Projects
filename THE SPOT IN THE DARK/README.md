<h3> THE SPOT IN THE DARK : POISSON’S SPOT </h3>
</br>

The Fresnel diffraction phenomenon referred to as Poisson’s spot or spot of Arago
has, beside its historical significance, become relevant in a number of fields. Among them are for
example fundamental tests of the super-position principle in the transition from quantum to classical
physics and the search for extra-solar planets using star shades. Poisson’s spot refers to the positive
on-axis wave interference in the shadow of any spherical or circular obstacle. While the spot’s
intensity is equal to the undisturbed field in the plane wave picture, its intensity in general depends
on a number of factors, namely the size and wavelength of the source, the size and surface corrugation
of the diffraction obstacle, and the distances between source, obstacle and detector. The intensity
can be calculated by solving the Fresnel–Kirchhoff diffraction integral numerically, which however
tends to be computationally expensive. We have therefore devised an analytical model for the on-axis
intensity of Poisson’s spot relative to the intensity of the undisturbed wave field and successfully
validated it both using a simple light diffraction setup and numerical methods. The model will be useful
for optimizing future Poisson-spot matter-wave diffraction experiments and determining under what
experimental conditions the spot can be observed.
